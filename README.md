Export all of your steam games to a CSV file

To install - download the HTML file to your desktop. Click.

You'll need to know two things to get this to work:

1. your personal steam profile ID: click on "Profile" when logged into steam via the web to get it... it's in the URL:
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/000000000/ where 00000000 is your ID,

2. your WebAPI key. Get that from here: http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey while logged in.

This is really simple HTML/Javascript, but it solves a very annoying problem without 3rd party services or the need to link your steam account to some dodgy site.

Good luck!

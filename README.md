Export all of your steam games to a CSV file

To install - download the HTML file to your desktop. Click.

You'll need three things to get this to work:

1. your personal steam profile ID: click on "Profile" when logged into steam via the web to get it... it's in the URL: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/000000000/ where "000000000" is your ID,

2. your WebAPI key. Get that from here: http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey while logged in.

3. Enable Cross Resource Object Sharing so the script on your local machine can talk to steampowered.com. There are two ways to do this.
    1. Use chrome and install an extension that allows you to disable it on demand: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en
    2. Start your browser in a special mode. See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6083677/2951509 for instructions

This is really simple HTML/Javascript, but it solves a very annoying problem without 3rd party services or the need to link your steam account to some dodgy site.

Good luck!
